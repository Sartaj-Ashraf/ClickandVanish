"Click & Vanish" is a timed challenge game where the player must click on 40 predefined boxes to make them disappear within a 30-second time limit. Each successful click removes a box, and the player's goal is to clear all boxes before time runs out. The game maintains a count of how many boxes the player manages to click, allowing for score tracking and self-improvement.

Features:
Predefined Boxes: 40 boxes are displayed at the start of the game.
Time Limit: You have 30 seconds to click on as many boxes as possible.
Count Tracking: The game tracks how many boxes you successfully clicked.
Challenge Mode: Try to clear all boxes before the timer runs out, or beat your previous count!
