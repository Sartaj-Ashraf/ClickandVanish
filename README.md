Click & Vanish is a timed challenge game where the player must click on 40 predefined boxes to make them disappear within a 30-second time limit. Each successful click removes a box, and the player's goal is to clear all the boxes before time runs out. The game keeps track of how many boxes the player manages to click, providing an opportunity for score tracking and self-improvement.
